  <h2>HOW TO PLAY:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You are Pacanvasman, the yellow guy. Move him with the arrow keys and
    eat all the orange dots!</li>
    <li>Watch out for the red ghost, though: if Pacanvasman gets too close, he dies
    and you lose!</li>
    <li>To evade the ghost, go through the open edges to warp to the other side!</li>
    <li>If you want to restart the game, just refresh the page.</li>
  </ul>
